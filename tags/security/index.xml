      <description>Supervised learning is a technique that aims to learn a hypothesis function $h$ that fits a behavior observed in the real-world, which is governed by an unknown function $f$.
To learn this function, we use a set of example data points composed of inputs (also called features) and outcomes (sometimes called labels). These example data points were sampled from the real world behavior, i.e. from the function $f$, at some time in the past.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Supervised learning is a technique that aims to learn a hypothesis function $h$ that fits a behavior observed in the real-world, which is governed by an unknown function $f$.</p>
<p>To learn this function, we use a set of example data points composed of inputs (also called features) and outcomes (sometimes called labels). These example data points were sampled from the real world behavior, i.e. from the function $f$, at some time in the past. Our goal is that we can extract knowledge from the past to figure out this behavior on unseen data beforehand. This knowledge extracted from the set of examples is materialized on the $h$ function.</p>
<p>In Security, we can imagine some examples where this would be useful, like trying to learn if an HTTP request contains malicious payload or if some set of bytes is a malware or not. However, supervised learning is less often used in Security than in many other domains.</p>
<p>This happens because the principles of the supervised learning theory conflicts with the nature of Security, limiting its application. But, by understanding these principles, it is also possible to see how to best apply this technique and how it can maybe useful.</p>
<h2 id="stationary-assumption">Stationary assumption</h2>
<p>The most important principle in supervised learning is the stationary assumption. When the data that represents the real world behaviors follows the stationary assumption, it means that predicting the behavior using past example is approximately correctly.</p>
<p>The <strong>stationary assumption</strong> states that the behavior that is being learned don&rsquo;t changeÂ through time. This has some important consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>We expect that each data point is independent of each other. This is important, because if there were causal effects between data points, then the features of a data point $x_1$, caused by $x_0$, would vary with a probability that is a combination of the probability distribution and the effect of $x_0$, hence the distribution would not remain the same over time, because $x_0$ and $x_1$ would vary in different ways. For example, in a box with 1 blue ball and 2 red balls, the probability of picking a blue ball when drawing the first one from the box is 33% while a red one would be 66%. However, if the first one is indeed blue, then the probability of drawing a red ball as the second one is 100%. The first data point (blue ball draw) changed the probability of the second data point.</li>
<li>We expect that each data point is identically distributed, i.e. each data point should be drawn from the same probability distribution. We could learn the shopping behavior using data ranging from Black Friday to New Years, however the users&rsquo; behavior in this time is completed different from the rest of the year, therefore the data used to learn has a different probability distribution than the unseen data on which we are going to make predictions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any dataset that follows these two characteristics is said to hold the i.i.d assumption (independent and identically distributed). The importance for our training datasets on supervised learning to be i.i.d is because it connects the past to the future, without it, any inference made on the available data would be invalid.</p>
<p>Understand the i.i.d assumption is specially important for Security Machine Learning because it is one of the areas where causality and behavior shifts are most present. So, exactly how this assumption affects our ability to do Supervised Machine Learning?</p>
<h3 id="causality">Causality</h3>
<p>Many threat behaviors have causal nature, and therefore we should have a lot of care when preparing our datasets and choosing our validation methods.</p>
<p>A good example is malware classification, where you could have many samples from various families from different years. Each family generation influences each other, and sometimes they have similar characteristics.
A special bad situation that could happen with this is that during splitting of the dataset between training and testing, without taking into account the time relation of the families and samples, then you could end up training the model with future information and testing against past samples. This would produce falsely accurate results that would not generalize in the real-world.</p>
<p>There are ways to deal with this, but it depends on the type and strength of the causal relation between the data. For this case, ensuring that the newest malware samples are used for test should be enough.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-shift">Behavior Shift</h3>
<p>We could create a model to learn a threat behavior like the profile of a botnet, however once we started responding effectively to it, adversaries would adapt and our model would become useless because the new botnets would have a totally different behavior.
This would be the case of a change in the probability distribution from which the features are drawn, leading to the break of our assumption.</p>
<h2 id="looking-to-the-other-side">Looking to the other side</h2>
<p>Although causality may be addressed by good data preparation, preventing a model to be become outdated due to behavioral shift is almost impossible. However, this problem isn&rsquo;t a new one in Security, such that one best practices is to instead of trying to detect and block malicious action, defenders should define what a legitimate system behavior looks like and block everything else. This can be summarized as: allow lists are more secure than block lists.</p>
<p>We can apply the same philosophy for supervised learning, by modeling profiles of legitimate behavior, which usually are more stable. Then, new data points are classified against these multiple profiles models, finally a meta-classifier is used to choose which one is the best fit or if it&rsquo;s an outlier. This has the ability to catch any new threat behavior that deviates from the know legitimate profiles.</p>
<p>This combination of multiple models is called ensemble learning, which has shown to improve models performance, like when comparing a Decision Tree model to a Random Forest one.</p>
<p>As a side bonus, since this way of building models does not depend on knowing threat behaviors, it avoids the common problem in mining data for Security that usually produce highly unbalanced datasets. We can train each profile using the true positive data of others profiles as false examples, assuming each profile is mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>The main challenge in this approach is that adversaries may try to mimic legitimate profiles, however like the authors of Notos showed, this can be useful sometimes, as in their cases this would imply in adversaries using a more stable network infrastructure that would be easily defeated by static block lists. Therefore, forcing adversaries to mimic a legitimate profile could also reduce their capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, supervised learning is a powerful technique that allows us to extract knowledge from past data points to predict future behavior. However, in the Security domain, applying it comes with unique challenges due to the presence of causality and behavior shifts. Understanding the stationary assumption and the importance of having an i.i.d dataset is crucial, because it informs us how to best prepare our datasets, choose our validation methods and, most importantly, what are the best behaviors to be modeled using supervised learning.</p>
<p>Luckily, by modeling profiles of legitimate behavior, and catching new threat behavior that deviates from known legitimate profiles, we can build intelligent allow lists.</p>
<p>While there are challenges, with proper preparation and understanding, supervised learning can be a valuable tool in Security.</p>

      <title>Implementing a safe and sound API Key authorization middleware in Go</title>

      <description>How to design a more secure API Key handling in Go</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="./cover.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>A common requirement that I face on multiple projects is to safeguard some API endpoints to administrative access, or to provide a secure way for other applications to consume our service in a controlled and traceable manner.</p>
<p>The usual solution for it is API Keys, a simple and effective authorization control mechanism that we can implement with a few lines of code. However, when doing, so we also need to be aware of threats and possible attacks that we may suffer, specially due to the usual privileges that these keys provides.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are going to analyze common points of concern and design a solution that improve our security posture while keeping it simple.</p>
<h2 id="api-keys-threats">API Keys threats</h2>
<p>There are two main concerns when implementing an API Key authorization scheme: <strong>key provisioning</strong> and <strong>timing attacks</strong>. Let&rsquo;s review each threat before designing solutions to address them.</p>
<h3 id="key-provisioning">Key Provisioning</h3>
<p>The key storage is directly related to how applications expect these secrets to be provided to them. Environment variables are the most common solution used on modern services since they are widely supported and don&rsquo;t incur a high reading cost (in contrast to files) allowing for dynamic changes to be easily detected.</p>
<p>However, the way developers usually define the environment variables are through scripts or configuration files, for example using a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Kubernetes Secret</a> manifest. This introduces a serious threat of API Keys being committed to git repositories, which in the event of data leakage from the internal VCS management system would expose these credentials.</p>
<p>Note: remember that once committed, even if the keys are deleted from the source files, the information is already on the repository history and is easily searchable with tools like <a href="https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog">TruffleHog</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>please do not commit your API Keys to git</strong>!</p>
<h3 id="timing-attacks">Timing Attacks</h3>
<p>Once your application is configured with the available API Keys, you need to verify that the end-user provided key (let&rsquo;s call this the <em>user key</em>) is correct. Doing so with a naive algorithm, like using == operator, will make the verification end on the first incorrect character, hence reducing the time taken to respond.</p>
<p>A timing attack takes advantage of this scenario by trying to guess the correct characters of a secret based on how long the application took to respond. If the guess is right, the response will take slightly longer than if it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Naturally, since equality checks are orders of magnitude faster than the network roundtrip, this type of attack is extremely difficult to perform because it depends on a statistical analysis of many response samples. By looking at the time distribution produced by two different characters, one can infer that if they are different, inferring that the greater one is the correct value. For an extensive discussion of statistical techniques to help perform this attack see <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Morgan-Web-Timing-Attacks-Made-Practical-wp.pdf">Morgan, Morgan 2015</a>.</p>
<h2 id="middleware-design-and-implementation">Middleware design and implementation</h2>
<p>Having these threats in mind, we can design a suitable solution. Let&rsquo;s start with the most simple API Key middleware implementation possible and iterate from it.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A middleware is a function that takes an <code>http.Handler</code> and returns an <code>http.Handler</code>. In this code, the function <code>ApiKeyMiddleware</code> is a factory that creates an instance of the middleware with the provided configuration and logger. The <code>config.Config</code> is a struct populated from environment variables and <code>logging.Logger</code> is an interface that can be implemented using any logging library or the standard library. You could pass only the header and map of keys, but for clarity we choose to denote the dependency from this middleware to the configuration.</p>
<p>After extracting the fields that it relies on, the function creates a reverse index of the API Keys, which is originally a map from a key id/name to the key value. Using this reverse index it&rsquo;s trivial to verify if the user key is valid by doing a map lookup on line 18.</p>
<p>However, this approach expects the API Keys as plaintext values and is susceptible to timing attacks, because its validation algorithm is not constant time.</p>
<h3 id="using-key-hashes-for-validation">Using key hashes for validation</h3>
<p>To improve the key provisioning workflow, we can use a simple yet effective solution: expect the available keys to be hashes. Using this approach we can now commit our key hashes to our repository because even in the event of a data leak they could not be reversed to their original value.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the SHA256 hashing algorithm to encode our keys. For example, if one of them is <code>123456789</code> (please, do not use a key like this :D) then its hash will be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">15e2b0d3c33891ebb0f1ef609ec419420c20e320ce94c65fbc8c3312448eb225
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now you can add this hash to your deployment script, Kubernetes Secret, etc., and commit it with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Next, we need to handle this new format on our middleware. This is what the code will look like now:</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we extracted the logic to validate the key into a function that, before checking the equality of the user key against the available ones, encodes the user key using the same SHA256 algorithm.</p>
<p>This simple step improved a lot our security posture without adding much complexity. Now we can have the benefits of version control, like change history and easy detection when someone changes a key hash.</p>
<p>This approach works well when there are few keys to be managed, and you want to follow a GitOps approach. However, if you need to scale the key management, allow for self-service key requests and automatic rotation, you may want to look for a solution like <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io">Hashicorp Vault</a>. Even using an external secret store I still believe this strategy, to rely on key hashes to be valid, because your external secret store can persist both the original key and the hash, and the access policy for the application can have fewer privileges in such a way that it can only read the hashes.</p>
<h3 id="constant-time-key-verification">Constant time key verification</h3>
<p>Once we have a better strategy to provision our keys, we need to defend ourselves against them being exfiltrated by timing attacks. The solution for this kind of vulnerability is to use an algorithm that takes the same time to produce a result whether the keys are equal or not. This is called a constant time comparison, and the Go Standard Library offers us an implementation in the <code>crypto/subtle</code> package that is perfect to solve most of our problems. Hence, we can update our code to use this package:</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, the function <code>apiKeyIsValid</code> uses <code>subtle.ConstantTimeCompare</code> to verify the user key against each available key. Since <code>subtle.ConstantTimeCompare</code> operates upon byte slices we don&rsquo;t cast our hash to string anymore and also our reversed index has gone in place of a decoded map.</p>
<p>The decoding is necessary because the string representation of our key hashes are actually a hexadecimal encoding of the binary value. Hence, we cannot just cast the string to byte slice because Go assumes all strings to be UTF-8 encoded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: for an example on how using a cast instead of the correct decoding function, the result of <code>[]byte(&quot;09&quot;)</code> is <code>110000111001</code> while <code>hex.DecodeString(&quot;09&quot;)</code> produces <code>1001</code>. Check out the live example <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/CPy16o7hvDO">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The major disadvantage of this solution is that now we need to iterate over all available keys before finding out if the key is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t scale well if there are too many keys, however one simple workaround would be to require the client to send an extra header with the key ID/name, e.g. <code>X-App-Key-ID</code>, with which you can find the key in <code>O(1)</code> and then apply the constant time comparison.</p>
<p>However, there is one subtle (<em>pun intended</em>) behavior from <code>subtle.ConstantTimeCompare</code> that we must be aware before deploying our solution to production. When the byte slices have different lengths, the functions returns earlier without performing the bitwise operations. This is natural because it does an XOR between each pair of bits from each slice, and with slices of different sizes, there would be bits from one slice without a matching pair to be combined with. <strong>Because of it, an adversary could measure that keys with the wrong length have a smaller response time than keys with the correct length, hence leaking the key length</strong>. It would only be a vulnerability if you use a short key that is easily brute-forced, but with a simple 30 character key using the UTF-8 printable characters you would have <code>30^95 = 2.12089515 Ã 10^140</code> possible keys.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ve built a simple, secure and efficient API Key solution that should handle a lot of uses cases without additional infrastructure or complexity. Using a basic understanding of threats and the Golang standard library, we could do a security-oriented design instead of leaving security as an after-though in an iterative way.</p>
